## Contribution Rules

- Keep `core/` independent from first-party modules.
- Keep `modules/` independent from service ownership.
- Keep `services/` free of persona and workspace source.
- Keep `deploy/` focused on operator paths, not runtime implementation.
- Do not copy live secrets, devbox runtime state, or installed dependencies into the release tree.

## Open-Source Readiness

Before proposing a release-side change as baseline-ready, confirm:

- no live credential or token is present
- no `node_modules/`, `dist/`, or local `.env` file is present
- docs point to release-side files first
- source boundaries are reflected in the migration mapping

Run:

```bash
cd Mira_Released_Version
npm run verify:release
npm run export:repo
```
